# Forward-and-Back-Propagation-on-Artificial-Neural-Networks-for-the-Classification-of-Movie-Genres-fr
In this project, we tried to implement a neural network in order to classify the genre of a film through features derived from its plot. Once the problem was defined and a solution implemented, we wondered how it was possible to optimize the network execution through parallel-programming techniques
